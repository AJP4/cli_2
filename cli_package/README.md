# Practice CLI Python Package

`-h, --help for help`

I used this reference for creating this CLI [medium blog](https://medium.com/@trstringer/the-easy-and-nice-way-to-do-cli-apps-in-python-5d9964dc950d)

I also created some pycharm helpers:

plugins:  commandline and batch (requires restart)


how to create pip Installations from [github](https://codeinthehole.com/tips/using-pip-and-requirementstxt-to-install-from-the-head-of-a-github-branch/).  How to guide. I ended up having to make repo public as I got into errors that I think were secuiryt related.


## Steps involved
*   Create package
*   Create `install.cmd` to script the creation of the setup.py 
*   Commit to github public repository (note I had trouble with pip freeze > requirements.txt when I had no remote created.  Not sure why.  Some messages on google but couldnt fathom out an answer).
